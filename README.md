# Hello World in Django

This `hello_world` example demonstrates the simplest Django view possible. In Django, a view is a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. This example shows how to create a basic view that returns a simple "Hello, World!" response when accessed.

## Code Description:

- The view is defined in a function called `hello_world`. This function is situated in the `views.py` file of a Django application.
- The function takes a single argument, `request`, which represents the incoming HTTP request.
- The function returns an `HttpResponse` object that contains the text "Hello, World!".
- To make this view accessible via a web browser, a URL pattern must be defined in the `urls.py` file, which points to the `hello_world` view function.

This example is typically used as a starting point to ensure that the basic setup of a Django project is correct, and that the server can handle a simple web request and return an appropriate response.

## Usage:

To use this `hello_world` view:
1. Define the view in the `views.py` file of your Django application.
2. Map the view to a URL by editing the `urls.py` file and adding a URL pattern that points to the `hello_world` view.
3. Start the Django development server.
4. Access the view in a web browser by navigating to the corresponding URL.

This simple example lays the foundation for creating more complex web applications using Django by illustrating the interaction between views and URLs.
